# Pirate MFA 2 - Morse-Core

## Description
*We need to collect all the keys to uncover the location of a lost treasure. [Key 2/3]

A'ight Matey,

Our radio keeps blasting some new EDM genre the zoomers refer to as "Morse-Core" or something.
Could you try and decipher if there is any "Deeper meaning" to the track?
I don't want the young'ns to think I'm a lame Capt'n...

Hint: write the output down for later ;)

*You must insert the output into the flag format to submit: ahoy{XXX} (contents of the flag is ALL CAPS)*
