# Pirate MFA 4 - Davy Jonesâ€™ BitLocker

## Description 
Now that we have gathered all the keys, we can unlock the lockbox to get the map.

After carefully investigating the lockbox, you discover is a very vague riddle on the back:

	"The password is: KEY1_KEY2_KEY3"

But honestly who knows what that means.
