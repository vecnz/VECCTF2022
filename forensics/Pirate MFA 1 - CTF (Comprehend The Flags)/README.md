# Pirate MFA 1 - CTF (Comprehend The Flags)

## Description
*We need to collect all the keys to uncover the location of a lost treasure. [Key 1/3]

Ok Crew, 

We have received one of the keys for the treasure, but there is a catch. 
The messengers decided that some fancy-pants flag dance was the best way to communicate such important info.

Hint: write the output down for later ;)

*You must insert the output into the flag format to submit: ahoy{XXX} (contents of the flag is ALL CAPS)*
